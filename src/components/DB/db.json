With countless restaurants, cafes, art galleries, special events, and more, this funky arts and entertainment district is a major Albany hotspot. The Spot on Lark is a beautifully renovated 1850s era 4 - story brick building, in the heart of Lark Street, and a perfect oasis to relax and explore. We have taken ample time to carefully craft this space with tasteful décor, to maximize its potential and ensure your enjoyment",
    "neighborhood_overview": "If you visit Albany’s Capital Region without seeing Lark Street, then you have indeed missed its unique and funky urban center. Lark Street is often referred to as the “Greenwich Village” of Albany’s Capital Region. The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance. <br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",

It is important to be our authentic selves, without being washed.  My home has ethnic food smells, flags, sarcastic signs, Black art, social justice signs and visiable security cameras.

    "neighborhood_overview": "If you visit Albany’s Capital Region without seeing Lark Street, then you have indeed missed its unique and funky urban center. Lark Street is often referred to as the “Greenwich Village” of Albany’s Capital Region. The area along Lark Street is reminiscent of the great and colorful neighborhoods of Manhattan, and is just steps from downtown Albany’s business district. Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance.<br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques. Lark Street is well known for the diverse selection of foods on offer, from Tex-Mex to Greek to Thai, Indian, Hunan, and more.",

Backyard fire pit, large garden with sitting areas, fruit trees, herbs, hammocks, and spaces to unwind, you won't even know you are in the city!",

There are public buses at the bottom of the block to downtown (10 minutes) and you can find neighborhood bars and restaurants that are a 7 minute walk away. The SUNY and State campus are each a 5-10 minute walk away. Grocery stores are a quick drive or short Uber trip away (and there are corner stores that are walkable where you can get essentials). <br /><br />Centrally located and close to the highway, we are only 35 minutes North to Saratoga (and SPAC), 50 minutes North to the lower ADK for hiking, or 50 minutes East to Tanglewood for hikes in the Berkshires or to listen to concerts there. And of course there is an abundance of food, music, and hiking to explore in the capital region! If you need suggestions just ask!",

I settled in Albany, NY, a hardworking, no-nonsense sort of town, drenched in history, education and politics. I love this town not just for the town itself as much as the location. It's truly a sportsman's(sportswoman's) paradise, while being so close to very civilized civilization. There's easy access to NYC, Saratoga, Lake George, Vermont, Montreal & my favorite The Berkshires in Massachusetts.",
